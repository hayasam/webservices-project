Web services are one of the most used services in the network, whenever a client needs to perform an activity and calls service-providing helping functions to use services which satisfy clients needs. Our project was also web service, which provides services to the client. 

Project goals include development of 3 Web Services, which helps the Client to perform the operation he wants. Of course, one of the goals were to get a better understanding of BPEL, REST, WSDL, XML and SOAP.

TravelGood company has other inner organs (other helping web services) and LameDuck which use BankServices. NiceView - which provide hotel services, LameDuck - flight services. All of the services provides a wide variety of commands, which a client can execute.
