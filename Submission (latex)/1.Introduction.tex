People, companies, universities all over the world are using internet. Some of them spend time surfing, reading or playing, but the others use services provided by internet. Web services are one of the most used services in the network, whenever the client needs to do some activity and calls service-providing helping functions to use services which satisfy clients needs. Our project was also web service, which provides services to the client. 

Project goals include development of 3 Web Services, which helps the Client to perform the operation he wants. Of course, one of the goals were to get a better understanding of BPEL, REST, WSDL, XML and SOAP. 

Project is combined of four services which interact with each other. It is called LameDuck, NiceView, TravelGood and BankService. Client wants to travel and he contacts the TravelGood company which provides travel services. TravelGood company has other inner organs (other helping web services) and LameDuck which use BankServices. NiceView - which provide hotel services, LameDuck - flying services. All of the services provides a wide variety of commands, which client can execute - get lists of flights / hotels, book or either cancel everything. Project also provides payment services, which are charging clients card is booking was done or compensating if it was cancelled.
