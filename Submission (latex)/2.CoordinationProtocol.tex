\section{Coordination Protocol}

We assume that the clients connecting to TravelGood are stand-alone applications calling our web services. This process starts by sending a customer/client reference identification through the \textit{CreateItinerary} operation, which will create a unique itinerary for the client. In the interaction with the client, the state itinerary changes and this is represented in the state diagram below (see figure \ref{statediagram}).  

In the state diagram several operation that can change the state of the itinerary are defined. Most of them, such as \textit{AddToItinerary}, \textit{GetHotels/Flights}, \textit{BookItinerary}, \textit{CancelItinerary} are self explanatory and well-defined in the project description. However, we should mention that \textit{TerminateItinerary}, although possible from all states (unbooked, booked, cancelled) has different meanings. The user is able to terminate the itinerary by calling the \textit{CancelItinerary} operation in the unbooked state. Concurrently, in the booked and cancelled states, it might happen that the itinerary is terminated whenever the date of a flight or a hotel has passed. 

As soon as an itinerary is terminated, it is removed from TravelGoods record therefore its status can not be called for anymore.

The coordination process between TravelGood, LameDuck and NiceView are similar for both our REST and BPEL implementations. Communication with the client happens only via the TravelGood web service which will afterwards concurrently connect to the external web services (LameDuck and NiceView). Moreover, both LameDuck and NiceView call operations from the FastMoney web service. All the connections between client the and services are portrayed in figure \ref{sequencediagram}.

As it can be seen as mentioned above, the client only interacts with the TravelGood service which will afterwards start a new itinerary and return its identifier. In BPEL, TravelGood creates a GUID identification for further communication whereas in REST, a unique string identifier is used. After the itinerary has been created, the client can request available flights and hotels from TravelGood, which will in turn request the info from the LameDuck and NiceView services. The result of \textit{GetFlights} and \textit{GetHotels} operations will be an itinerary which holds two arrays, one for the list of flights and one for the list of hotels. 

During the booking (\textit{BookItinerary}) process, the client application is required to also send the bank information along with the itinerary id. This operation can return a fault if booking fails and all exceptions are handled properly (see \ref{webserviceimplementations}. Web Service Implementations). 
Similarly, the cancel itinerary operation (\textit{CancelItinerary}) also requires a booking number and credit card info and can return an error if some parts of the cancellation fail.
